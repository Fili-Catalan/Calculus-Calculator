/**
 * This is an abstract class that will be useful in providing general tools
 * needed to identify the rules needed to differentiate or integral an equation.
 * 
 * Every single equation will need some sort of scheme drawn up on how to properly
 * differentiate/integrate a methematical expression. This seems like overkill for
 * some instances, but the reason for this 'overkill' is a result of the symbolics
 * involved. The end result needs a symbolic output. As a result, order matters. 
 * In order to preserve order, you need rules. You must be ruthless in establishing
 * order with your Calculus, otherwise everything falls apart.
